                    This paper introduces a novel hybrid framework for semantic video retrieval and localized caching in surveillance systems. This approach employs a two-tiered computer vision strategy using a real-time YOLO model deployed at the network edge combined with OpenAI's CLIP, where embeddings are generated to capture rich, high-dimensional zero-shot semantic content. These embeddings are then synchronized with a cloud-based vector database to establish a semantically indexed reservoir for query processing. Finally, we leverage a Large Language Model (LLM) augmented with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to process natural language queries and index cached frames.

                        Contemporary methods for stochastically generating climate-change impacted rainfall patterns involve site-based stochastic methods. This paper builds on recent IBM Research methods using VAE models to better model co-variant rainfall patterns by using a prior-posterior sampling method based on latent space.
